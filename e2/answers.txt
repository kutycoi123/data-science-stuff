1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept?
   What is the type, and describe the values.
   - The calculation is the predictions for dog ratings
   - Type of result is a Panda Series. Values are ratings predictions for all timestamps that we retrieved from dog_rates_tweets.csv
2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?
   Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
   - It produces a fit line on the graph because we used linear regression to compute "fit" based on df['timestamp'] and df['rates']
   So all the values will lie on a line with linear equation: y = x.(fit.slope) + fit.intercept, where x can be replaced by any timestamp and y is the predicted rate
   - created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly because all timestamp values are converted from created_at values.
     The reason why we need to convert created_at values to timestamp values is because we used scipy.stats.linregress method to compute linear regression, which
     only works with number. Timestamp values are numbers that represents number of seconds after some epoch. 
     They essentially means the same but just in different format/unit.
