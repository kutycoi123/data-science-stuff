1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? \
   Briefly explain why or why not.
   - Naturally, it is harsh for humans to survive in cold area and it's also not an ideal environment for us to develop under such a low temperature.
   Therefore, I think we can use daily temperature data to somehow predict population density because people seems to prefer living in
   warm areas. If we look at the results we have for this assignment, there are more people living in cities with average temperature from 15 to 30 °C
   than from cities with avg temperature from -5 to 10 °C. 
2. The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed on disk throughout the analysis.
   Decompressing every time we run the program seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with an uncompressed .json data?
   - Working wih decompressed json might be faster than with an uncompressed json file because decompressing json helps to remove unnecessary and duplicated
   details, therefore, it results in smaller and lighter file. This is a good trade off for json compression and helps to speed up file I/O
