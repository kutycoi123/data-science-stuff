1. 	I cached two intermediate joined results because they are used to create groupby data frames
and to be written to the file
	The performance would be quite slower if I did not use cache() anywhere
2.	Broadcast helps to improve the program speed by nearly 60% because instead of doing join operation,
it takes the advantage of the fact that one of joined dataframe is really small so it can quickly
look up	the result.
