1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?
   - Using square root transform gave me the best results to satisfy
   the assumptions of T-test
2. The conclusion would be if null hypothesis is rejected is:
   - Original T-test: The average number of comments posted on weekdays are different than on weekends
   - Transformed data T-test: The average square root number of comments posted
   on weekdays are different than on weekends
   - By-week test: The average number of comments posted on weekdays are different than on weekends
   for each week.
   - Mann-Whitney test: It is likely that number of comments on weekdays is more than weekends or
   vice versa, but it's not likely both are evenly shuffled.
3. The Mann-Whitney U-test approach seems to do a better job since it helps us to reject the null hypothesis
   and we can conclude that the data in both sets are not evenly shuffled, or one data set is likely to be
   larger than the other.
4. There are more number of comments posted on weekdays than on weekends
